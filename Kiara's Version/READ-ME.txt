## Description

The Study Space Finder is a web application designed to help college students, specifically those at Case Western Reserve University, locate suitable study spaces on campus. It provides detailed information about each study space, including descriptions, operating hours, and the ability to book or reserve a space. The goal is to enhance students' productivity by facilitating the discovery of the ideal study environment.

## Business Requirements

This web application is intended for use by colleges and universities, with an initial pilot deployment at Case Western Reserve University.

## User Requirements

To access the application, users must log in with their Case Western Reserve Student ID, limiting access to college students at Case Western Reserve University.

## Vision

The vision of this web application is to empower students to efficiently find study spaces that maximize their productivity. It acknowledges the diversity of study preferences among students, including indoor vs. outdoor settings, background noise, or silence. The application aims to overcome the limited resources available to help students discover their ideal study areas by providing a centralized database. This database contains essential information such as hours of operation, environment descriptions, images, and reviews from other students. By streamlining the reservation process and making all campus spaces accessible through a single platform, the application increases convenience and aims to improve students' academic performance at CWRU.

## Scope and Limitations

This project primarily targets the student audience at Case Western Reserve University. While the ideal scenario involves implementing the model at universities nationwide, this is a challenging and extensive process that exceeds the scope of a single semester. Additionally, setting up the platform for each college would require individual communication. As a result, the pilot application's scope is limited to the Case Western Reserve University campus.
